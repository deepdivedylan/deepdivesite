      <p>
        Deep Dive Coders was founded by John Mierzwa. John was Vice President of Sales and Operations for a $218M company in Las Vegas, NV and he understands that employers are looking to hire software developers who already have experience working on actual business problems. That&#8217;s why Deep Dive Coders is a project-based program, with our students working on apps to solve real-world challenges in pairs and teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in Las Vegas, John received his Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Business Management and founded a <a title="John Mierzwa - Alumnus Article" href="http://www.phoenixfocus.com/2011-08/alumnus-john-mierzwa/">successful language school</a>, which focuses on quickly teaching people to use their new language skills in a real-life workplace setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        John returned to his hometown of Albuquerque and became involved with helping grow the startup scene here as founding Co-Chairman of <a title="Startup New Mexico" href="http://startupnm.org">Startup New Mexico</a> and as one of the founders of the <a title="ABQ Tech Fiesta" href="http://www.techfiestaabq.com/">ABQ Tech Fiesta</a>. He loves technology and startups and believes the more people who become interested in coding the better off we'll all be.

        Dylan McDonald is a computer scientist by education, a programmer by trade, a teacher by passion, and he's ecstatic to be able to combine and share his interests and experience with students at Deep Dive Coders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dylan earned his Master's Degree in Computer Science from Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology. He had been a software engineer for the previous several years prior to making the long-desired move to Albuquerque, where he loves to hike and enjoy the gorgeous weather and great food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dylan views computer science as much a craft as it is a science, and he's always viewed it as an exploration of mathematics in search of the most efficient and elegant way of solving problems. With programming as in nature, true beauty can be found in an effective, simple solution.
