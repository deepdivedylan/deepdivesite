>War Games at Deep Dive Coders

>At Deep Dive Coders, we&#8217;ve been learning about secure web development since day one. But last Friday, during our Security Day War Games, we learned just how easy it was to attack insecure sites. How easy? Many of us had no exposure to hacking, but in just a couple of hours, we were able to pull off attacks such as SQL injection, shell injection, cross-site scripting and password cracking.</span></em></span></p>
>For our War Games, we were divided into two teams. Our instructor, Dylan McDonald built two sites containing common vulnerabilities. It was our job to quickly defend our site, while launching attacks on the other team&#8217;s site. Over two intense hours, we gained points by successfully launching attacks and by defending our site against the other team.</span></em></span></p>
>In preparation for the War Games, Dylan described the kinds of attacks we could do, but never taught us how to do them. This was a big part of the challenge for us was to figure how to pull off these attacks. We really only had one guide: recognizing where good coding practices weren&#8217;t being followed.</span></em></span></p>
>Before we get into how to defend sites, we should ask, why is security that important? Well, in our SQL injection attacks, we were able to access and destroy all the database information. In our shell injection attacks, we got command line access to the server. We were able to download usernames and passwords and crack the hash. Obviously, we were playing with dummy sites, but if these were business sites, companies could have lost time and money or had sensitive information stolen. Since privacy is the currency of the internet, we must do our best to reasonably protect our information.</span></em></span></p>
 >Protecting Your Site< 
 >Thankfully, it is relatively easy to protect your site from the majority of attacks if you follow secure coding practices. PHP and mySQLi have many built-in functions to help you in this.</span></em></span></p>
 >Input Sanitization< 
 >Regular expressions have become one of our best friends in this. At first, these crazy combinations of characters confused and scared us, but now we are comfortable designing and testing them for all sorts of different inputs.</span></em></span></p>
 >PHP&#8217;s htmlspecialchars() is also a great tactic in sanitizing inputs that later get displayed on a webpage, such as comments on a blog post. It takes out html tags, which prevents cross-site scripting attacks.</span></em></span></p>
 >If you absolutely need to use a shell command (which we recommend you do are rarely as possible), escapeshellarg() and escapeshellcmd() do exactly what the names say, escape commands and arguments for shell. These are your best bet to prevent injection attacks. If you are running an external program, you need to use these or a simple â€œ;â€? will turn your input into a command line for your server.</span></em></span></p>
 >Taking the time to prepare statements and bind parameters are the best protection from SQL injection. This practice checks the query for obvious attacks, ensures that only one SQL statement is present and verifies the input types are what we expect. These two simple methods accomplish so much! Both of them are built-in features in mySQLi that are really easy to implement.</span></em></span></p>
 >Now that we&#8217;ve covered server-side sanitization, what about client-side? jQuery form validation is a good practice, but it isn&#8217;t enough since all you need to do is turn off JavaScript on your browser to get around it.</span></em></span></p>
 >The same goes for drop down menus and checkboxes. They are great protection against incompetent users, but they are completely ineffective against malicious users. Be aware that users can tools such as Inspect Element in Chrome to arbitrarily change these values. This is, in fact, how we launched some of our attacks in the War Games.</span></em></span></p>
 >The best practice in input sanitization is to sanitize client side and server side multiple times.</span></em></span></p>
 >What we learned< 
 >The only thing more surprising than how easy it was to launch all of these attacks was how easy it was to defend against them. There is no excuse not to do the simple work necessary to defend your site against malicious input. Protecting your site is more work, but like physical exercise, once you get in the habit, you do it automatically.</span></em></span></p>
 >Dylan has been teaching us these safe coding practices all along, often without us knowing why they were secure at the time. He himself is very security minded and instrumental in laying down a strong security foundation for us. This foundation goes well beyond application security to using good password hashes and salt, proper encryption and more.</span></em></span></p>
 >Taking the mindset of the attacker drove home how important security is for a good web developer, plus it was really fun.</span></em></span></p>

 "><a title="StartupABQ" href="http://startupabq.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://startupabq.org']);" target="_blank">StartupABQ</a> had its first kickoff event on Thursday morning at the Hotel Andaluz, where a group of 40 gathered to hear pitches and updates from three of the city’s startups.<br />
The event, hosted by Micaela Brown and <a title="John's LinkedIn profile" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmierzwa" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.linkedin.com']);" target="_blank">John Mierzwa</a>, is the first of what they hope to be monthly events at the Downtown hotel.<br />
Rodney Herrington of Aqua Research gave the crowd an update on his H2GO water purifier. Santiago Rojas Carbonell talked about Batterade and Juan Certain talked about The Brew.<br />
Startup ABQ is part of the nationwide Startup America Partnership, a group that encourages entrepreneurs to meet and present their companies to other entrepreneurs.<br />
“We’re going to promote the crud monkey out of this,” Brown said. “It’s for all industries. Our economy has a lot of entrepreneurs and they need a little more leverage to explode on a national level.”<br />
At Thursday’s presentation, Herrington explained how his company is developing the H2GO and has recently signed distribution deals.<br />
Rojas Carbonell talked about how, with sugar and water, University of New Mexico researchers figured out a way to make small amounts of electricity, enough to power a cell phone. He and his partner, Joe Dougherty, licensed the technology from UNM and are planning to deploy a cell phone battery charger in areas of the world that don’t have access to a power grid.<br />
Certain, of The Brew, talked about how the vertically-integrated coffee company has grown plans to open a second coffee shop in Northeast Albuquerque in April.</span><br />

 >Rachel Honeth Kim dreamed of starting her own business. But since graduating from Harvard Business School in 2011, one thing held her back: $60,000 in student loans. So Kim sold herself to investors. Literally. Kim sold equity in her personal career using a site called <a href="https://www.upstart.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.upstart.com']);" target="_blank">Upstart.com</a>. She uploaded a profile with her transcripts, GMAT and SAT scores, pay stubs, resume and a photo. Then she requested $100,000 from investors to pay off her loans and cover startup costs. In return, she offered a cut of her pretax income for 10 years. Call it a new form of credit, a new equity class, or even a twist on indentured servitude. Either way, young people with debt and dreams are turning to unconventional fundraising sites like Upstart, Lumni and Pave that let them offer a piece of their future earnings in exchange for a lump sum of cash. They&#8217;re using the money to pay off loans, start companies &#8212; even train to be professional athletes&#8230;</em></span></span></p>

 >Thoughts on fast-track programming schools 
 >Here&#8217;s my take: First and foremost, the best way to learn anything is through immersion in the topic. I&#8217;m not sure how anyone would argue with that contention. Therefore, if you&#8217;re interested in learning computer programming and making that your career, then choosing a bootcamp that matches your budget, focus languages, and location is your best choice.</span></p>
 > That being said, any potential employers will realize you&#8217;ve been coding for only a few intense months and will plan to train you in their needs as necessary. They&#8217;re not going to expect you to be an expert when you walk in the door, but they&#8217;ll know you&#8217;ve been exposed to the terminology, tools, methodology and focus that are required to be a successful programmer, and that you&#8217;ve actually been coding hands-on for several months. That&#8217;s more than can usually be expected from computer science graduates who have had their (probably significantly less) hands-on programming experience spreak out over four years, often with days and weeks between programming sessions. Not the most effective way to ingrain complex topics.</span></p>
 > Another key component from an employer perspective is the appreciation of the commitment the bootcamp students have shown by investing so much of their time and money into their skills improvement. It does matter.</span></p>
 > I believe that programming bootcamps are just the first wave in the coming tsunami of immersion learning in the U.S. The fact is that employers want their entry-level employees to come to them with hands-on experience and a good foundation of the basic skills needed for the job. For too many years they have been largely disappointed in this respect, and bootcamps are a proven method to produce work-ready employees.</span></p>

 >With 2013 coming to an end, there’s one thing left on our minds: What will 2014 bring? While we can’t answer that question across the board, we can offer insight into the new year’s top technology hiring trends.</span></em></h3>
 >As we recently discussed following Salesforce CEO
 <a title="Tech trends from Dreamforce 2013" href="http://blog.rht.com/5-technology-trends-to-keep-your-eye-on/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://blog.rht.com']);" target="_blank">Marc Benioff’s keynote</a> <span style="color: #000000;">at Dreamforce 2013, social, mobile, cloud and the Internet of Things remain four top tech trends on everyone’s list. Yet when it comes to trends affecting hiring, mobile continues to lead the pack, as the proliferation of this technology has made developers and analysts indispensable. Below are the top five positions we expect to see grow in 2014. Let us know if you agree in the comments.</span></span></em></p>
 >The Five Positions Tech Departments Are Adding to Their Teams in 2014< 
 
 <a title="So hot right now: Mobile app developers" href="http://blog.rht.com/mobile-app-development-hot-skill-hard-find-candidates/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://blog.rht.com']);" target="_blank">Mobile apps developer</a> </b><span style="color: #000000;">–<b> </b>Average starting salary increase: 7.8 percent<b> </b></span></span></em></li>

As this trend continues to grow, the need for mobile applications developers will, too.</span></span></em></p>
According to title="Gartner's top tech trends of 2014" href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2603623" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.gartner.com']);" target="_blank">Gartner’s strategic technology trends for 2014</a><span style="color: #000000;">, “Improved JavaScript performance will begin to push HTML5 and the browser as a mainstream enterprise application development environment.” Gartner goes on to recommend that developers “focus on creating expanded user interface models, including richer voice and video, that can connect people in new and different ways.”</span></span></em></p>
 >Because it’s a bull market for mobile developers of nearly all skill levels, competition for top talent remains steep. Look for developers with the following skills, then be ready to pay them competitively:</span></em></p>
 
 >Experience developing mobile applications for major platforms such as iOS, Android and Windows phones 
 >Experience with mobile development languages such as Objective-C, Java for Android and/or C# for Windows Phone<  
 >Experience with responsive design for mobile-ready websites< 
 >Experience with web development languages such as HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript frameworks (jQuery, BootStrap, EXT_JS)<

 >Since the advent of the   'http://www.gartner.com' >Internet of Things , the need for skilled software developers and software engineers has increased drastically. This should come as no surprise as now nearly any physical thing – like your car – requires a just-as-integral software component.</span></span></em></p>
 >However, organizations are still working to fill the inevitable skills gap that accompanied the Internet of Things. “The problem is that most enterprises and technology vendors have yet to explore the possibilities of an expanded internet and are not operationally or organizationally ready,” according to Gartner.</span></em></p>
 >Make sure you’re prepared not just for the Internet of Things, but the Internet of Everything. Look for software developers and engineers who are adept at creating engineering specifications for software programs and applications, collaborating with hardware engineers to test hardware/software interaction and implementing specific development methodologies.</span></em></p>

 >Tag, you’re it, business intelligence analysts. It has been a long time coming, but finally Wall Street cannot compete with tech organizations and departments for top business intelligence analysts. Why is that? One reason is Big Data. With so much data, companies need business-minded technology professionals to analyze it so they can glean valuable insights.</span></em></p>
 >Look for business intelligence analysts who can:
 >Design and develop enterprise-wide data analysis and reporting solutions 
 >Review and analyze data from multiple internal and external sources 
 >Communicate analysis results and make recommendations to senior management< 
 >Data architect – Average starting salary increase: 7.2 percent< 
 >Just like with business intelligence analysts, it’s the Big Data trend that is keeping data architects in such high demand. Because data architects require both analytical and creative skills, along with in-depth knowledge of data systems and database methodology, design and modeling, they have all your various “Big Data Vs” covered – volume, variety, velocity and veracity.</span></em></p>
 >Look for candidates with an educational background in computer science or a related field, as well as experience with Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server or other databases in various operating system environments, such as Unix, Linux, Solaris and Microsoft Windows.</span></em></p>
 >Developer / programmer analyst  – Average starting salary increase: 7.1 percent

Because developer / programmer analysts deal with both the technical and business side, as well as participate on project teams, they are the perfect addition to bridge the gap between the two sides of the business.</span></span></em></p>
 Make sure you’re not falling behind the competition; staff up on developer and programmer analysts that have strong analytical and problem-solving skills. These analysts are more than developers, they’re creative thinkers who can write code, test and debug software applications, then recommend system changes and enhancements.</span></em></p>

Six Great Telecommuting Careers With High Pay< 
>Don&#8217;t want to sacrifice a great paycheck for the ability to work from home? With these six careers, you don&#8217;t have to. 
 >By Andrea Duchon 
 >Growing up, you often think of professional success in terms of your workplace &#8211; corner office with a view, anyone? But as you get older, your idea of the most desirable place to work might shift into something a bit more fluid and a little less 9-to-5. 
 >Danielle Mund, a certified career and entrepreneur coach, explains that telecommuting is on the rise, despite recent debates about its merits in business. But which careers can easily be done outside the office?
 >&#8220;The easiest careers to telecommute in are those that aren&#8217;t as much about communal decision-making as they are about creation,&#8221; says Mund. 
 >&#8220;These careers tend to have the need to be free from distractions, like colleagues popping into your cubicle unannounced, for example,&#8221; says Mund. But that&#8217;s not all. Changes in technology have obviously made it much easier to work remotely. &#8220;The Internet and the cell phone have made it infinitely more accessible to work outside of a traditional setting,&#8221; says Mund.
 >Healthy paycheck. Comfortable digs. Never changing out of your pajamas &#8211; what more could you ask for? Curious which jobs might lead you home? Keep reading to learn about six high-paying careers where you may be able to literally phone it in.
 
 >Career #2:
 <a href="http://match.education.yahoo.net/school-match/?commandName=inquiry&amp;programCategoryId=7000&amp;programSubcategoryId=7002&amp;svkid=1O1BA&amp;usid=f2249371-fcb2-4c72-a532-58c05a47a9cc&ampamp;svkid=1O1BA" onclick="javascriptn>Computer Programmer
  > Think you might have what it takes to be a programmer but aren&#8217;t sure you&#8217;re cut out for office life? Computer programming may provide the opportunity to ditch the cubicle and work from home &#8211; and the pay isn&#8217;t bad, either. 
 >Computer programmers create, test, and fix bugs in software programs by working with computer code, says the U.S. Department of Labor. These programs range from simple mobile applications for cell phones to more complicated computer operating systems.
 Why It&#8217;s Ideal for Telecommuting: The two reasons this career is great for telecommuters stem from the fact that it requires a computer and it involves creativity, says Mund. 
 >&#8220;Because you can work from anywhere with only an outlet and an Internet connection, it&#8217;s not difficult to choose the place where you&#8217;re most productive instead of focusing on punching the clock,&#8221; she says.
 >The second reason, Mund adds, is that despite the technical nature of the work, it is actually quite creative. &#8220;Generally speaking, programmers solve the types of problems that must be solved by one person, not a team. When a programmer can work away from distractions like coworkers, he or she can get work done more effectively.&#8221; 
 Salary Potential: And if you work effectively, salary for this career could be in your favor, too. The Department of Labor lists median annual wage for computer programmers as $74,280. The top 90th percentile of employees earns $117,890, while the bottom 10th percentile earns $42,850
 
 >Career #6:
 <a href="http://match.education.yahoo.net/school-match/?commandName=inquiry&amp;programCategoryId=7000&amp;programSubcategoryId=7006&amp;svkid=1O1BA&amp;usid=f2249371-fcb2-4c72-a532-58c05a47a9cc&amp;svkid=1O1BA" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://match.education.yahoo.net']);"><span style="color: #000000;">Software Developer
  > Ever wonder how and why your computer works when you turn it on and open up a program? The answer is software developers. These creative types develop the applications that run on your computer or other devices, and constantly work to make sure that they function correctly, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. But how are they able to work from their couch and still make a great salary?</span></em></p>
 >Why It&#8217;s Ideal for Telecommuting:  Developers, like programmers, work exclusively from computers, so they&#8217;re already set up to telecommute. Mund says that this career also requires a type of creation, so it&#8217;s best done when you can get into the &#8220;flow.&#8221;</span></em></p>
 >She defines flow as a state of concentration and complete focus on the activity in front of you. And as anyone who&#8217;s worked in an office before can tell you, &#8220;flow&#8221; isn&#8217;t as easily achieved in a traditional setting where you&#8217;re likely to be distracted.</span></em></p>
 Salary Potential: If you earn median salary as an applications software developer, you could expect to see $90,060, according to the Department of Labor. The top 90th percentile makes $138,880, while the bottom 10th percentile makes $55,190.</span><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000;"> </span></em></p>
