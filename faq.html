      </p>
      <p>
        Here in Albuquerque, starting salary for our graduates and for other companies we survey is around $40K-$60K, with the range moving up to $60K-$90K with just a couple years of experience. In many other cities around the U.S., starting pay is more like $70K-$90K and up.

      </p>
      <p>
        Your hard work and coding skills gained through our program will best determine the jobs you're offered once you graduate; of course, coders are in high demand here in Albuquerque and everywhere so your prospects will be great and we'll do everything we can to promote you.
      </p>
      <p>
        During your program we'll actively promote you to our partner employers and through our extensive networks, to make sure lots of people know about you and your hacktastic skills. We are in constant touch with companies who are eager and even rather desperate to hire programmers. Since you'll ultimately be the one persuading employers to hire you, you'll also need to develop your personal and digital brand, and we'll help you there as well.

      </p>
      <p>
        It's better than for any other skill or career. Software development/web development/programming jobs are projected to grow at about a 30% rate over the coming decade, which is much faster than overall job growth. According to employers and recruiters we talk to and survey in Albuquerque and elsewhere, the unemployment rate for coders is about 2%, with companies competing to hire talent. For example, we attend various hiring events, and the employers are making sure to let prospective programmers know they offer amenities such as fitness memberships, food, a fun atmosphere and other such perks to entice developers to join their teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through our ongoing conversations and surveys, we find most of Albuquerque's top companies are planning to hire more programmers, including entry-level coders, for the foreseeable future. Other cities are equally short of programmers to fill available jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention, the salaries for software and web developers are much, much higher than for most careers.

        <a name="howmuchistuition" class="questionLink">How much is tuition?</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        $500 scholarships available. If you find the program not fulfilling your expectations within the initial two weeks, we'll refund your pro-rated tuition less the $1000 deposit.

        Once you're accepted to our program, you'll attend Monday through Thursday, 8:30a to 5:30p and Friday 8:30a to 1p, for 9 weeks. You'll have breaks and lunch of course, and most students will choose to continue coding into the night and on weekends with classmates to hone their skills and build more apps. After all, she or he who has the most coding experience will learn faster and may get the best jobs, right?

      </p>
      <p>
        Your desire to become a programmer, your hard work and enthusiasm, and your eagerness to learn in pairs and as part of a team. You'll also need to bring your laptop (most developers use Macs, but many use PCs as well - it's your choice) armed with an up-to-date operating system to be sure it works well with the software you'll use during the camp. We strongly recommend you bring an additional monitor as well, as working with two monitors is certainly more efficient and enjoyable. Headphones/earbuds are standard programmer gear too. Beyond that, you'll need to be ready to be immersed in the science and art of web development and programming.

      <p>
        Sure, as long as your boss will pay you for the 9 weeks you're here, or else give you a leave of absence to attend. Otherwise, you need to plan to have little else going on in your life while you learn and practice at least 50-60 hours per week either in class or coding with friends and/or on your own.

      <p>
        You'll arrive at Deep Dive Coders brimming with enthusiasm and ready for 2+ months of hard work and massive additions to your brain, your confidence and your skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll teach you the languages, tools and techniques used to build today's best websites, software and apps, including HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery and CSS3 on the browser side,  then MySQL, and lots of PHP on the server side.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll become proficient with test environments, GitHub collaboration and version control tools, Agile Development Methodology, and other professional development tools and best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you graduate, you'll have the skills of a PHP programmer and web developer to entice employers to hire you as an employee, or for freelance work, depending on your goals.

      <p>
        <a name="whatisatypicaldaylike" class="questionLink">What's a typical day in the life of a Deep Dive Coder look like?</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8:00am: </strong>We'll provide coffee/soft drinks and something to munch on, we'll talk about our code and get prepped for the day. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8:30am: </strong>Let's get to work on today's first lessons. We'll review any questions that arose from your coding work from the night before, and make sure the stage is set for today's projects. Questions will be asked, with answers and guidance offered in return.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9:00am: </strong>The hands-on commences, with pairs and teams as the perfect structure to attack the day's set of hands-on projects. The extra pair of eyes will help you focus on your work, find answers to questions quickly, and generally shave your learning curve. Your roving instructor will be available to provide a boost through a roadblock, a relevant shortcut, or real-life examples for guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12:15pm: </strong>Time to refuel! Options abound for tasty lunches of many flavors at nearby establishments, or bring your own lunch fixings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1:00pm: </strong>Let's talk about your amazing insights from this morning's projects, and introduce this afternoon's challenges.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2:00pm: </strong>Time to take a break and do something to refresh your mind and body. A couple times a week we'll wander next door and get a quick, customized training routine in at <a href="http://www.rebelworkout.com/">Rebel Workout</a> - it's included in your tuition of course. Other days let's take a walk and have some more conversations. You know lots of great ideas are born when we unplug for a little while and find a different perspective. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2:45pm: </strong>More hacking. Your brain will expand even further as we lay out projects and activities for you and your Divemates to explore and accomplish. Your instructor will be astonished at your progress, and will occasionally assist you just to be sure they feel needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4:30pm: </strong>Often, we'll have local developers, employers and others visit to share their coding, business and hiring experiences and to have some Q & A time with you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5:30pm: </strong>Yes time flies when you're having such fun, but it's time to break off for the evening and eat again. We're officially done for the day, but most of you will likely choose to continue building your apps and projects during or after you find something to eat for dinner. After all, the more hands-on coding stuff you and your Divemates can experiment with during your 9 weeks here, the better prepared and more attractive you'll be for prospective employers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Evenings and weekends: </strong>You'll revisit and organize the copious notes you've taken during class days and practice what you've learned thus far. You'll also get some well-deserved down time to refresh and recharge.
      </p>
      <p class="pull-right"><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>
      <p>
        <a name="doIneedpriorexperience" class="questionLink">Do I need prior programming experience?</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a word: no. You will, however, need a true desire to become a programmer and software developer. You'll also need the energy and enthusiasm to commit 9 weeks to completely dive into your learning. You should arrive able to use a computer and the internet very well, and know your way around a keyboard though.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll definitely need to be ready to focus all day, every day while you're here. This much information and learning won't happen well if you're updating your Facebook status, tweeting, texting and/or making phone calls during class times. So don't do it! Put your phone away! You, your classmates, your instructors and your future employer will all appreciate the laser-like focus you give to the material and lessons during your camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure that you and your classmates begin the program with some basic terminology and web development knowledge, you'll complete the required prework (around 20-50 hours) prior to your on-ground start date.

      </p>
      <p>
        Then plan to move here for at least 9 weeks as a start to your new career as a programmer. But beware, Albuquerque is an addicting place to be, with many programming job opportunities, amazing outdoor, cultural and other leisure activities,  and a very low cost of living - so you may find your move becomes permanent.

        <a name="whatsthecostoflivinginABQ" class="questionLink">What about housing, cost of living, stuff to do in Albuquerque?</a>
      <p>
        Albuquerque is the <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/11/laid-back-albuquerque-millennials-see-chance-live-well/7612/?goback=%2Egde_2704043_member_5814490839581208579#%21">best city for Millennials</a>. We have a much lower cost of living compared to most cities, with lots of houses and apartments available for rent. You may even be able to room with some of your classmates during your stay here. In fact, you could probably travel here, attend Deep Dive Coders for 2+ months, rent a place, eat, drink, etc., then return home and still end up paying much less than just the tuition cost if you chose another coding boot camp somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albuquerque has great weather, 320+ days of sunshine, a vibrant university area near Deep Dive Coders, lots of bike trails, tasty local brews, and many food choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although you'll be doing tons of coding with little free time left over, there are lots of fun things to do in the city and the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albuquerque was named as one of the top places to build wealth by Salary.com thanks to its reasonable housing, activities and prices in general. Housing especially is significantly cheaper than in most cities.

        You'll learn to create and manipulate the look and feel of a site, and as you're learning the front and backend languages and functionality you'll be better able to integrate all aspects of your software and apps into a finely-tuned result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, once you know PHP and the full AMP stack you're in a great position to learn other dynamic web languages such as Ruby and Python if desired and/or necessary.

      <p>
        We seriously doubt it. We would like you to be at least out of high school, unless you attend during your summer vacation, because you won't have enough hours in the day to attend both high school and our program at the same time. And while it may currently be true that techies' ages often skew to the younger side, more and more employers are realizing that a mix of age, ability, energy and experience make great teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as you love technology, are proficient with a computer, have the passion to commit to becoming a programmer in 9 weeks, and plan to get a programming job soon after graduation, you'll fit right in here at Deep Dive Coders.
