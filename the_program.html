      <h3>Initial Phase - Introduction and Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Weeks 1-2: </strong>During the first couple of weeks you'll learn to talk and work as a hacker, how all the different parts work together to make software run, and become familiar with the <a title="Wikipedia AMP stack" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apache%E2%80%93MySQL%E2%80%93PHP_packages">AMP</a> stack. You'll learn to use a variety of development tools and you'll start building your own stuff.
      </p>
      <h3>Second Phase - Preparation and Development</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Weeks 3-5: </strong>The reasons for learning a variety of tools and skills the initial few weeks will become clearer as you modify existing code and build your own through pair coding and your individual work. The gloves come off as you take projects from ideas, to bits and bytes, to functioning on the web - just as you always pictured it happening. Your fingers have now become one with your laptop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since your goal is to get a programming job, some of your best projects going forward will be included in your portfolio. Your portfolio will enable employers to see the coding work you have done with your own two hands.
      </p>
      <h3>Final Phase - Execution and Deployment</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Weeks 6-9: </strong>The home stretch is when you really deep dive into PHP coding and build out your portfolio for prospective employers. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how much it all makes sense to you now. You'll be creating clean, functional and documented code, which is exactly what employers are looking and paying for.
      </p>
      <h3>And now on to a great coding job!</h3>
      <p>
        We have in New Mexico an expanding network of employers who will need to hire web developers and software engineers, and they'll be taking a look at you. We'll continually promote you and your coding skills, as well as the strong work ethic you've demonstrated during your time at Deep Dive Coders. Of course you are responsible for getting your job in the end, but we'll do all we can to help.
      </p>
      <h3>Tuition</h3>
      <p>
        Only *<em>$4995 </em>for the 2-1/2 month program, for a limited time. A <em>$1000</em> non-refundable deposit is required to secure your spot in the course and begin the prework, and payment in full is required prior to your on-ground course start date. <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500">*Stated tuition rate is valid for the next upcoming course (06/02/14) only. Tuition rates for subsequent courses may be increased without prior notice.</span>
      </p>
      <h3>Discounts / Scholarships</h3>
      <p>
        We're committed to helping build a diverse tech community. If you're a veteran, a woman, or belong to another underrepresented group (Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, African American) let us know and you'll be eligible to receive a <em>$500</em> scholarship.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you accept and work at least 100 days at a full-time job with one of our partner companies, we'll refund up to <em>$1000</em> of your tuition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Potential tuition financing help</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have partnered with the two leading organizations who are funding high-potential individuals to help achieve their dreams. Both companies are eager to fund coding boocamp students, due to the many job opportunities and high salaries in the software and web development professions. These programs offer an avenue for students to finance their Deep Dive Coders education.
      </p>
      <p>
        You create your profile and get backers to invest in you through the site. Once you get a job, you then pay back a small portion of your salary each month.
