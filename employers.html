	<h3>Employers</h3>
<p>Welcome Employers!</p>
<p>Thanks to our employer and recruiter partners who joined us for an informal Meet &amp; Greet with our graduating students at Deep Dive Coders on 12/12/13. They were able to get to know our aspiring web developers / programmers, enjoy some refreshments, and have casual conversations with others from the Abq tech community.</p>
 
<p>If you're seeking motivated, well-trained programmers and web developers to join your team, then you've come to the right place.</p>
<p>If your organization has specific programming concepts you need your current or potential developers to learn, give us an email or call and we&#8217;ll discuss how we may incorporate that subject matter into our upcoming bootcamp curriculum, or perhaps it makes sense to collaborate even deeper and create a program designed around your exact needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We know you need great people to bring your product or service to market, and to grow at a pace that makes sense for your business. When companies tell us they aren't able to find enough skilled talent for their business it just drives us crazy, so we're doing something about it.</p>
<p>Graduates of Deep Dive Coders are serious about coding and have each invested 2-1/2 immersive, full-time months, plus their hard-earned $, to learning the craft and art of modern web development with PHP. This 360 hours of hands-on, project-based programming has helped create Albuquerque's newest group of talented web developers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We look forward to letting you know all about our students' work ethic and problem-solving skills, and especially to sharing with you their portfolio of work. We're confident you'll recognize the potential in our graduates and that you'll be anxious to meet them and talk about how they may fit into your team.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For more information and/or to become a partner employer, please contact us at: <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=hello@deepdivecoders.com">hello@deepdivecoders.com</a> or at (505) 720-1380.</p>

<p>Thanks, we look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
